# Timecard

A CLI-based task management system developed using COBOL.

## Notes

- Use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format when asked to input a date (eg. 16th April 2025 is `2025-04-16`).
- Inputs are not case sensitive only in the main console (when entering commands, with `>` visible) - `> HELP`, `> Help`, and `>help` are all valid inputs.

## Extras

I started this project on 2025-12-30, less than 48hrs before New Year's eve. The primary reason for why I started is [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)'s [Flavourtown](https://flavourtown.hackclub.com) event - which gave me the opportunity to get domain credits to renew my domains hahahaa, as well as get some cool tech stuff.

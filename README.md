# Timecard

A CLI-based task management system developed using COBOL.

## Notes

- Use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format when asked to input a date (eg. 16th April 2025 is 2025-04-16).
- Inputs are not case sensitive only in the main console (when entering commands, with `>` visible) - `> HELP`, `> Help`, and `>help` are all valid.

- I made Timecard for Hack Club's [Flavourtown](https://flavourtown.hackclub.com) event.
